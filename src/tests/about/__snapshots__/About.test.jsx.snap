        Currently pursuing a Computer Science Degree in Singapore. As a Computer Science student, I see learning as a continuous journey to evolve myself personally and professionally. Beyond the classroom, I\`m open to exploring opportunities to grow as a developer through hands-on projects and internships, where I can learn from real-world challenges and contribute to impactful software.
